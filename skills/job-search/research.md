# Research Patterns — Job Search

## Company Due Diligence

### Financial Health
- Crunchbase: funding rounds, runway
- News: layoffs, hiring freezes, acquisitions
- LinkedIn: headcount trends (growing/shrinking)

### Culture Signals
- Glassdoor: filter reviews to last 6 months
- LinkedIn: average tenure of employees
- Team pages: diversity, turnover in leadership

### Red Flag Checklist
| Check | Red Flag |
|-------|----------|
| Job posting age | >90 days = ghost or turnover |
| Salary transparency | "DOE" or missing = likely lowball |
| Interview rounds | >5 rounds = indecisive org |
| Review sentiment | "Great people, bad management" pattern |
| Growth claims | "Hyper-growth" with flat headcount |
